<h1 class="container">Hi, Welcome to my blog, this is under constructions. sorry for the Inconvenience</h1>
<p> I know this looks lame but here is the first article i would love to share, This is by far the excellent article available on the
    internet regarding <a href="http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm" >"how HTML and CSS get parsed by the browsers"</a> in other words how browsers work,
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately Majority articles are about saying how things work on a broader perspective, but they dont specify "under the hood"
    details. I am working on to get details about how the JS is actually parsed, will post it shortly.
    PS : I know they are available is some text books but who wants to read lengthy and wordy text books?????
